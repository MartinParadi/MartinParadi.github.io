    <h1>Viper</h1>
    <p class="bemutatkozas">"The American chemist, Viper deploys an array of <br> poisonous chemical devices to control the battlefield <br> and cripple the enemy's vision. If the toxins don't kill <br> her prey, her mind games surely will."</p>
    <h2>Passive</h2>
    <h3>Fuel</h3>
    <p class="fuel">Fuel is a Resource Bar for Viper which gives her 100 Fuel. Activating only Poison Cloud or Toxic Screen requires Viper to consume Fuel at a rate of 1 every 0.15 seconds (6.667/sec). However, Viper can have both abilities active, which consumes Fuel at a rate of 1 every 0.1 seconds (10/sec). If her fuel levels run out, the abilities automatically deactivate and Viper must wait for her fuel levels to replenish, which will happen at a rate of 1 every 0.2 seconds (5/sec).

        Viper must have a minimum of 20 Fuel to activate a fueled ability.</p>
    <h3>Toxin</h3>
    <p class="fuel">Toxin is a Decay passive for Viper. If an enemy agent comes into contact with her Vision Blocker abilities (Poison Cloud, Toxic Screen, Viper's Pit), their health will begin to decay. They will instantly decay 30 HP upon contact, then continue to decay for 1 HP every 0.1 seconds (10 HP/sec). If no longer in contact, the debuff will briefly remain for 1.5 seconds before their health begins to climb back up at a rate of 1 HP every 0.04 seconds (25 HP/sec), up to a maximum of how much HP they would have if they had not been affected, taking any damage and healing taken whilst they were decayed into account.</p>
    <h2>C (Snake Bite)</h2>
<p>	
    EQUIP a chemical launcher. FIRE to launch a canister that shatters upon hitting the floor, creating a lingering chemical zone that damages and applies Vulnerable.</p>
    <h2>Q (Poison Cloud)</h2>
<p>EQUIP a gas emitter. FIRE to throw the emitter that perpetually remains throughout the round. ALT FIRE to lob. RE-USE the ability to create a toxic gas cloud at the cost of fuel. This ability can be RE-USED more than once and can be picked up to be REDEPLOYED.</p>
    <h2>E (Toxic Screen)</h2>
<p>	
    EQUIP a gas emitter launcher. FIRE to deploy a long line of gas emitters. RE-USE the ability to create a tall wall of toxic gas at the cost of fuel. This ability can be RE-USED more than once.</p>
    <h2>Ultimate (Viper's pit)</h2>
<p>EQUIP a chemical sprayer. FIRE to spray a chemical cloud in all directions around Viper, creating a large cloud that reduces the vision range of players and maximum health of enemies inside of it. HOLD the ability key to disperse the cloud early.</p>
